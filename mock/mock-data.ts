      title: 'Linear Regression',
      header: 'Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and classic algorithms in machine learning and the starting point for many complex models.It\'s easy to understand, but it solves many practical problems, such us forecasting house prices, anlyzing sales trends, or studying the relationship between variables. This article will take you from scratch to comprehensively analyze the principle, mathematical basis, loss function, optimization function, and practical application scenarios of linear regression.',
      body: `<div>1. The principle of linear regression</div>
      The core of linear regresssion is to establish linear relationships between variables through data, which is used to predict or explain phenomena. It's the foundation of supervised learning and is widely used in various fields.
      <div>1.1 What is linear regression</div>
      <div>1.1.1 Definitions and Intuitive Understanding</div>
      Linear regression is a statistical method designed to model a linear relationship between the independent variable (the input feature) and the dependent variable (the output target). In simple terms, it tries to find a straight line (or high-dimensional hyperplane) so that the line is as close to all the date points as possible. </br>
      For example, if we want to predict house prices, we can use the size of the house as the independent variable and the house price as the dependent variable. Linear regression finds a straight line that allows us to predict house prices as accurately as possible by area.
      <div>1.1.2 Basic Assumtions</div>
      The effectiveness of linear regression relies on several key assumptions:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Linear relationship:</b> There is a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable (which can be preliminarily vefified with a scatter plot).</li>
        <li><b>Independence:</b> Data points are independent if each other and are not affected by other data points.</li>
        <li><b>Homoscedasticity:</b> The variable of the error is consistent across all data points (e.g. the error is evenly distributed).</li>
        <li><b>Normality:</b> Errors obey a normal distribution (although in practice it's not necessarily strictly required).</li>
        <li><b>No multicollinearity (when multivariate):</b> The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.</li>
      </ul>
      These assumptions may not fully hold true in the real world, but linear regression can still provide meaningful predictions.
      <div>1.2 Mathematical representation of linear regression</div>
      <div>1.2.1 Univariate linear regression</div>
      For the case where there is only one independent variable, the mathematical formula for linear regression is:
      <span style="text-align: center;">y = Î²0 + Î²1x + Îµ</span>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>y: Dependent variable (forecast target, e.g. house price)</li>
        <li>x: Independent variable (input feature, e.g. house area)</li>
        <li>Î²0: Intercept (the intersection of the line and the y-axis)</li>
        <li>Î²1: Slope (indicates the magnitude of the effect of x on y)</li>
        <li>Îµ: Error term (random noise, part of the model that cannot be interpreted)</li>
      </ul>
      Our goal is to learn the best values of Î²0 and Î²1 from data.
      <div>1.2.2 Multivariate linear regression</div>
      When there are multiple independent variables, the formula expands to:
      <span style="text-align: center;">y = Î²0 + Î²1x1 + Î²2x2 + ... + Î²pxp + Îµ</span>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>x1, x2, ..., xp: Multiple independent variables (e.g. area, number of rooms, floors)</li>
        <li>Î²1, Î²2, ..., Î²p: The weight of each independent variable</li>
      </ul>
      For example, forecasting a house price may require a combination of factors such us size, location, and year of construction.
      <div>1.2.3 Matrix form</div>
      For ease of calcution, multivariate linear regression is often represented as a matrix:
      <span style="text-align: center;">y = XÎ² + Îµ</span>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>y: Vector of dependent variables</li>
        <li>X: Feature matrix (each row is a sample, each column is a feature)</li>
        <li>Î²: parameter vector</li>
        <li>Îµ: Error vector</li>
      </ul>
      This form is very common in programming implementations such as NumPy, or scikit-learn.
      <div>1.3 Visual Understanding</div>
      Let's say we have the following data:
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>House Area (x)</th>
            <th>Rate (y)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>100</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>70</td>
            <td>130</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>90</td>
            <td>160</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      Linear regression fits a straight line (e.g. y = 1.5x + 25) as shown below:
      <img src="/assets/images/linear-regression-0.png" alt="Linear Regression" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
      This line is as close as possible to all points, and the error (e.g. the distance from the point to the line) is minimized.
      <div>1.4 Application Scenarios</div>
      Linear regression can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Economics</b>: Forecasting the relationship between inflation and interest rates.</li>
        <li><b>Medical</b>: To study the association between weight and blood pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Bussiness</b>: Analyze the link between advertising investment and sales.</li>
        <li><b>Engineering</b>: Predict the strength of a material as a function of temperature.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>2. Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)</div>
      The loss function is the core indicator to measure the prediction effect of the model, and the mean square error (MSE) is the most commonly used choice in linear regression.
      <div>2.1 Why do you need a loss function?</div>
      The predicted value of the model cannot be exactly equal to the true value, and there will always be errors. The role of the loss function is to quantify these errors, help us evaluate how good the model is, and guide parameter adjustments. For example, if the predicted house price deviates too much from the actual value, we need a "standard" to measure this deviation.
      <div>2.2 Definition of MSE</div>
      The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated as the average of the squares of the difference between the predicted value and the true value by the formula:
      <span style="text-align: center;">
        MSE = \\(\\frac{ 1}{ n } \\sum_{ i=1 } ^ { n }(y_i - \\hat{ y }_i) ^ 2\\)
      </span>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>n: Number of data points</li>
        <li>y_i: The true value of data point i</li>
        <li>\\hat{ y }_i: The predicted value for data point i</li>
      </ul>
      <div>2.3 Features of MSE</div>
      <div>2.3.1 Pros </div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Superior mathematically</b>: MSE is a convex function with a unique global minimum for optimization.</li>
        <li><b>Penalty large error</b>: The square term amplifies the effect of large error and promts the model to reduce signficant bias.</li>
        <li><b>Easy derivation</b>: Facilitate subsequent gradient descent optimization.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>2.3.2 Limitations</div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Sensitive to outliers</b>: If there are outiliers in the data, such us luxyry homes in house pricr data, the square term can significantly amplify its impact.</li>
        <li><b>Unit problem</b>: The value of the MSE depends on the unit of the data, ehich is not intuitive enough.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>2.4 Visual Explanation</div>
      The MSE can be thought of as the average of all data points squared by the vertical distance to the fitted line:
